      <h1>What Does an Eviction Notice Mean?</h1>
      <p>
        Receiving an eviction notice can be stressful, confusing, and overwhelming.
        This page explains—plainly and calmly—what an eviction notice usually means,
        what it does <strong>not</strong> mean, and what tenants commonly do next.
      </p>

      <h2>An eviction notice is a warning, not an eviction</h2>
      <p>
        In most cases, an eviction notice is the first formal step in a longer process.
        It is a written notice from a landlord stating that a lease issue exists and
        that action may follow if the issue is not addressed.
      </p>

      <h2>What an eviction notice usually means</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The landlord is claiming a problem under the lease or tenancy</li>
        <li>A deadline is being stated</li>
        <li>The issue may move to court if not resolved</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What an eviction notice does NOT usually mean</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are immediately removed from your home</li>
        <li>You must leave the same day</li>
        <li>A court judgment already exists</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why timing matters</h2>
      <p>
        Eviction notices almost always include dates. Missing deadlines can reduce
        options later, so understanding your notice early is important.
