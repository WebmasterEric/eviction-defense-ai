# Eviction Notice Types – General Guide

Eviction notices are written documents that inform a tenant that the landlord is starting the eviction process.

Notice requirements vary by location, but many notices fall into common categories.

Receiving a notice does **not** mean you are immediately evicted.

## Pay-or-Quit Notice (Nonpayment)

This notice is typically issued when rent is overdue.

Common features:
- States the amount allegedly owed
- Provides a deadline to pay or take another action
- Warns that failure to respond may lead to court filing

Tenants should:
- Verify amounts listed
- Check payment history
- Track deadlines carefully

---

## Cure-or-Quit Notice (Lease Violation)

Issued when a landlord claims a lease violation.

Examples include:
- Unauthorized occupants
- Pets in violation of lease terms
- Property damage

The notice often allows time to correct (“cure”) the issue.

---

## Unconditional Quit Notice

This notice demands that the tenant vacate without an opportunity to fix the issue.

Often associated with:
- Repeated violations
- Serious lease breaches
- Certain prohibited activities

These notices typically require **immediate attention**.

---

## Notice to Terminate Tenancy

Used when ending a tenancy without alleging wrongdoing.

Common scenarios:
- Month-to-month tenancy termination
- Lease expiration without renewal

Deadlines are usually longer than other notice types.

---

## Notice After Court Filing

In some cases, tenants first learn about eviction through:
- A summons
- A court complaint

This indicates the eviction process has already entered the court system.

---

## Important Notes

- Notice formats and timelines vary by jurisdiction
- Deadlines are often strict
- Ignoring a notice can reduce available options
