# Eviction Process – General Overview

While eviction laws vary by state and locality, most eviction cases follow a similar structure.

Understanding the general process can help tenants respond on time.

---

## Step 1: Eviction Notice

A landlord usually starts the process by serving a written notice.

Common notice reasons include:
- Nonpayment of rent
- Lease violations
- End of lease or tenancy

Receiving a notice does NOT mean you are immediately evicted.

## Step 2: Filing of an Eviction Case

If the issue is not resolved, the landlord may file an eviction case with the court.

Tenants may receive:
- A summons
- A complaint
- A court date

---

## Step 3: Court Appearance

Tenants are typically required to appear in court.

Missing a court date can result in a default judgment.

## Step 4: Judgment & Enforcement

If a judgment is entered, enforcement usually follows additional steps.

There are often **time windows** where tenants may:
- File responses
