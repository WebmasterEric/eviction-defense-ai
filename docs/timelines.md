# Eviction Timelines – General Overview

Eviction timelines differ by location, but many cases follow a predictable sequence.

Understanding timing can help tenants avoid missed deadlines.

---

## Typical Eviction Timeline (High-Level)

1. Notice is served
2. Notice period expires
3. Landlord files court case
4. Tenant receives court papers
5. Court appearance or hearing
6. Judgment (if any)
7. Enforcement phase

Not every case reaches every step.

## Notice Period Phase

After receiving a notice:
- Deadlines may range from a few days to several weeks
- Some notices allow corrective action
- Others proceed directly to court

Tracking dates is critical at this stage.

---

## Court Filing Phase

If the landlord files a case:
- Tenants are usually served with court documents
- A court date may be scheduled
- Responses may be required before or on the hearing date

Failure to respond can result in default judgment.

---

## Court Hearing Phase

During hearings:
- Both parties may present information
- Tenants may raise defenses or procedural issues
- Outcomes vary by case facts and jurisdiction

---

## Post-Judgment Phase

If a judgment is entered:
- Enforcement does not always happen immediately
- Additional notices or waiting periods may apply
- Some options may still exist depending on timing

---

## Why Timing Matters

Many tenant options are **time-sensitive**.

Understanding where you are in the timeline helps determine:
- What actions are still possible
- Which documents may be needed
- How urgently to act

Optional self-help document kits are available for tenants who need structured guidance.
